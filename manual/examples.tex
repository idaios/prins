\chapter*{Examples}

\prins\ package contains a folder named `data'. There is an executable file, run.sh, which contains instructions (commands) that download and analyze the 83 protein structures used in the \cite{Jha2011} study. To execute the script just do:



\begin{itemize}
\item \verb!cd data!
\item \verb!./run.sh!
\end{itemize}


You will need internet connection to run the script properly. The reason is that the protein structures are downloaded by the script.
