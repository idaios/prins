The goal of \prins\ is to detect residues in a protein with a significant functional role. \prins\ implements a simple statistical idea, that can be summarized as follows: Residual-interactions that are statistically rare are preserved during evolution only if there is an important fitness-related reason able to counteract the fact that the interaction is unfavorable. In other words, some residual-interactions are observed rarely because the interactions are not favored. If a certain residue has a sufficient number of those interactions, it means that there should be some reason that this residue has been preserved during evolution. For example, it might be that the specific aminoacid has some important functional role and thus, it cannot be substituted by another residue. 

\prins\ is developed in C programming language and is available as an open-source software under the GPLv3.0 license.
